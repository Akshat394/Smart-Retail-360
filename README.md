## ML Microservice Integration

A Python FastAPI microservice can be used to provide real ML predictions, anomaly detection, and explanations for the Smart Retail 360 platform.

### Endpoints
- `/predict`: Returns predictions for input data.
- `/detect-anomalies`: Returns detected anomalies for input data.

### How to Run
1. Go to the `ml_service/` directory (create it if it doesn't exist).
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn scikit-learn joblib
   ```
3. Start the service:
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
   ```
4. The Node.js backend will call this service for ML tasks.

See `ml_service/main.py` for example code.
