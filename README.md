## Blockchain Features

Smart-Retail-360 includes a robust blockchain-inspired module for supply chain transparency, green token incentives, and smart contract automation. This feature is designed for both demo and real-world extensibility.

### Key Features
- **Product Traceability:** Track a product's journey and verify authenticity using blockchain-style hashes.
- **Green Tokens:** Mint, burn, and view green tokens awarded for sustainable actions (e.g., low-CO₂ delivery). Includes a leaderboard for top holders.
- **Smart Contracts:** Automate supply chain actions (quality checks, carbon offset payments, compliance) and monitor contract status and execution history.

### How to Use
- **Navigate to the Blockchain section** in the app sidebar.
- **Traceability Panel:** Enter a product ID (e.g., `PROD-12345`) to view its supply chain trace and verify authenticity.
- **Green Tokens Panel:** View your token balance, mint/burn tokens, and see the leaderboard. Tooltips and onboarding banners explain each action.
- **Smart Contracts Panel:** View, execute, and monitor smart contracts. Tooltips and onboarding banners guide you.

### Demo Mode
- If the backend is not connected to a real blockchain or data is unavailable, the UI will display a "Demo Mode" banner and use simulated data for a seamless demo experience.

### API Endpoints
- `/api/blockchain/trace/:productId` — Get product traceability
- `/api/blockchain/green-tokens/mint` — Mint green tokens
- `/api/blockchain/green-tokens/burn` — Burn green tokens
- `/api/blockchain/green-tokens/balance/:owner` — Get token balance
- `/api/blockchain/green-tokens/leaderboard` — Get leaderboard
- `/api/blockchain/smart-contracts` — List smart contracts
- `/api/blockchain/smart-contracts/executions` — List contract executions
- `/api/blockchain/smart-contract/:contractId/execute` — Execute a contract
- `/api/blockchain/authenticity/:productId` — Verify product authenticity

### Testnet/Real Blockchain
- The current implementation is blockchain-inspired and can be extended to use real smart contracts on a testnet (e.g., Polygon, Goerli) by updating backend logic and providing contract addresses/ABIs.

### Security
- All sensitive actions are proxied through the backend. No private keys are exposed in the frontend.
